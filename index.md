I am currently a senior studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley. I will be joining Stanford Univeristy this fall to pursue my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

As an undergraduate, I worked in Professor Laura Waller's [Computational Imaging Lab](http://www.laurawaller.com/) on digital holography and phase retrieval via partial coherence illumination. I also had the opportunity to work in Professor Robert Knight's [Cognitive Neuroscience](http://knightlab.berkeley.edu/) lab developing an algorithm for automated identification of neural oscillatory components.
