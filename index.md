I am a third year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Chris
Ré](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/) and affiliated with
the [DAWN](http://dawn.cs.stanford.edu) and [Infolab](http://infolab.stanford.edu) groups. I am supported by the [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details) and the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org).

My research interests revolve making machine learning easily usable for domain experts who do not have access to the massive datasets required for training complex models. I am also interested in exploring the intersection between machine learning and programming languages to improve how models are supervised and reduce user effort in training these models. 

My CV is [here](cv.pdf).

#### Projects
##### Coral: Enriching Statistical Models with Static Analysis
###### NIPS 2017, NIPS ML4H 2017, MED-NIPS 2017
We introduce a weak supervision framework to efficiently label image and video training data given a small set of user-defined heuristics. We identify correlations among heuristics using static analysis and incorporate this information into a generative model that can optimally assign probabilistic labels to training data. We apply this method to video querying and medical image classification tasks, outperforming fully supervised models in some cases.

##### Socratic Learning: Finding Latent Subsets in Training Data
###### HILDA 2017, NIPS FILM 2016
We explore how we can find latent subsets in training data that affect the behavior of weak supervision sources. We automatically identify these subsets using disagreements between the discriminative and generative models and correct misspecified generative models accordingly. We improve upon existing relation extraction and sentiment analysis tasks and make these latent subsets interpretable for users.

##### Babble Labble: Learning from Natural Language Explanations
###### NIPS 2017 DEMO
[Braden Hancock](https://www.bradenhancock.com/) and I explore how we can use natural language explanations for why crowd workers provide the labels they do to label training data more efficiently. We automatically parse these explanations into executable functions and apply them to large amounts of unlabeled data. We find that collecting explanations allows us to build high quality training sets much faster than collecting labels alone.

#### In the Past
Previously, I worked on problems related to computational imaging. As an undergraduate at UC Berkeley, I studied phase retrieval via partial coherence
illumination and digital holography in Prof. Laura Waller's [Computational Imaging
Lab](http://www.laurawaller.com/). I also rotated with Prof. Gordon Wetzstein’s [Computational Imaging
Group](http://www.computationalimaging.org) and looked at solving 3D
deconvolution problems more efficiently.

#### Teaching
At UC Berkeley, I was a teaching assistant for the first offering of [EE16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/) and helped develop course material for the class as well. I was also a teaching assistant for EE20: Structure and Interpretation of Signals and Systems.
