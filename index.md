I am a graduate student at Stanford University pursuing my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering, supported by the [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details) and the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org). 

In Autumn 2015, I rotated in Professor Olav Solgaard’s [Microphotonics Lab](http://web.stanford.edu/group/sml/cgi-bin/index.php), working on identifying abnormal stem cells in quantitative phase images.Currently, I am rotating with Professor Gordon Wetzstein’s [Computational Imaging Group] (http://www.computationalimaging.org) looking at solving 3D deconvolution problems efficiently.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in May 2015. As an undergraduate, I worked in Professor Laura Waller's [Computational Imaging Lab](http://www.laurawaller.com/) on digital holography and phase retrieval via partial coherence illumination. I also had the opportunity to work in Professor Robert Knight's [Cognitive Neuroscience](http://knightlab.berkeley.edu/) lab, developing an algorithm for automated identification of neural oscillatory components.
